### I'm a Web Designer and Front-End Web Developer from the Dominican Republic.

I have 4+ years of experience in remote work, UI/UX design and front-end web development.

#### A little background

I spent four years (2011-2015) learning to cope with freezing temperatures by living in Michigan, where I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Media and Information concentrating in Interactive Media at Michigan State University.

While at MSU, I worked at SNworks as a Web Designer and Developer. SNworks is a web development company by The State News, the university’s student newspaper, that creates websites for college media organizations around the country. We built fully-responsive sites that were developed using HTML5, CSS3, LESS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Grunt, Twig and Git, and powered by a proprietary Content Management System, Gryphon.

After graduating from Michigan State, I returned to the Dominican Republic and started working at Codemera, a small independent software company. At Codemera, I have worked with various clients from all over the world, building websites and web applications. I have learned to work with new frameworks, like Angular.js and Django.
